# Working
* Integration of transformer-based language models (CTransformers, ctransformers) for NLP tasks.
* Use of **HuggingFaceBgeEmbeddings** for generating text embeddings from Hugging Face's models.
* Implementation of **FAISS** for efficient similarity search in vector storage.
* Development of a retrieval-based question-answering system using RetrievalQA.
* Document processing and text splitting with **PyPDFLoader** and RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.
* Configuration management for variables like model checkpoint and embedding model using a config module.
* Creation of a bot capable of processing natural language queries and retrieving information.
* Use of the **LLama2 7b model** as a retriever for enhanced information retrieval efficiency and accuracy.
